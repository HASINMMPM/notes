Wireframing is a process that involves creating a blueprint for a website, app, or other digital product

##### Best Practice 
- Start with **pen & paper** for initial concepts.
- Use **grayscale** to focus on layout, not visuals.
- Keep content **hierarchical** (most important elements should stand out).
- Maintain **consistency** across screens.
- Use **placeholders** (e.g., “X” for images).
- Annotate wireframes if needed (explain interactions or data dependencies).
- **Test early and often** – even rough wireframes can get feedback.

		- Low-fidelity wireframes only include the most [basic elements](https://www.visily.ai/blog/wireframe-elements/) of a design. This can include boxes representing images, text lines, and placeholders for other features.
		- Low-fidelity wireframes are often called paper wireframes due to their simplicity.
